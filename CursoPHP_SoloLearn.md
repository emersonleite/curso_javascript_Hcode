# Welcome to PHP

  
  
PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor (**PHP**) is a free, highly popular, open source scripting language. PHP scripts are executed on the **server**.  
  
Just a short list of what PHP is capable of:  
- Generating dynamic page content  
- Creating, opening, reading, writing, deleting, and closing files on the server  
- Collecting form data  
- Adding, deleting, and modifying information stored in your database  
- controlling user-access  
- encrypting data  
- and much more!  
  
Before starting this tutorial, you should have a basic understanding of **HTML**.  
PHP has enough power to work at the core of  **WordPress**, the busiest blogging system on the web. It also has the degree of depth required to run  **Facebook**, the web's largest social network!
